Abstract  
  
Growing  need for environmentally friendly  transportation 
has led to the rise of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)"
"  Plug -in 
hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs ), whic h are a sub -class of 
HEVs , provide lower fuel consumption and exhaust gas 
emissions thanks to their e xternal charging and higher range 
of electric drive capabilities "
" Therefore,  they are  increasingly 
popular in the automotive i ndustry  nowada ys"

rapid assessment of th e cont rol or the ene rgy management 
strate gies applied to a PHEV , the generation of a  vehicle 
model has a crucial  role"

responsive, data -driven, kinematic, and map -based PHEV  
model  in a Python environment "

categories to express the charge -sustaining  (CS) and charge -

" Introduction  
 
Hybrid electric vehicles  (HEVs ) consist ing of two energy 
converte rs, generall y an internal co mbustion engine (ICE) as a 
prim ary energ y converter and one or mo re electric motor  (EM)  
as seconda ry energy co nverters , are nowada ys one of the m ost 
promising  solution s for not only environmental  pollution but 
also fu el eco nomy [1]"
" Compared to HEVs, plug-in hybrid 
electric veh icles (PHEVs) provide lower fuel co nsumptio n and 
exhaust gas emission  thanks to their external cha rging and 
higher ran ge of electric driv e capabili ties [2]"
" Although there are 
several powertrain topolo gies of PHEVs  in the industry , parallel 
type-2 (P2) architecture  is one of  the most used  architectures 
due to its increased energy recuperation potential and the 
availabilit y of additional hybrid cont rol functions "
" Therefore, a 
P2-type PHEV is used for modeling  purpo ses in our study "
" 
P2 ar chitecture  permits separate or combined  traction from 
ICE and EM based on the driver's  request "
" Thus,  torque 
distribution between ICE and E M is a substa ntial topic and is 
mostly studied  under  the tit le of  energy m anagement "
" Energy 
management strategies in the literature are mainly classified into 
two categories: rule-based  and optimization -based methods "
"

deterministic and fuzzy"
" Optimization -based methods, on t he 
other hand, are divided into global, real -time, and local 
strategies  [3]"
" Global optimizati on-based methods such as 
dynamic programming (DP) or the Pontryagin minimi zation 
principle (PMP)  cannot be used in real -time or fa st-respon se 
required applications due to their computational comple xity"
" 
However, rule -based  methods as well as  real-time and local 
optimiz ation-based methods namely , equivalent consumption minimizati on strategy (ECMS) , adaptive -ECMS (A-ECMS) , 
robust control (RC) , and artificial intelligen ce (AI) based  energ y 
management strateg ies are useful for real-time or fast-response 
required application s [4]"
" 
Apart from vehicle models, energy management strateg ies 
are a lso developed for various type s of vehi cles"

are obtained  using the generated maps from the data "

" Mode  Selection Strategy  
  
For a mode  selection between electric and hybrid drive , a 
stochastic  approach was implemented in the vehi cle model "
" The 
residency of th e hybrid and el ectric mode selection can be s een 
in Fig"

" Whil e ICE and EM operate  simultaneously in hybrid 
mode  as three , only the EM operates  in electric mode  which is 
expressed as two"
" The numbers between two and three are the 
avera ge value s of the mode when t he veh icle operates in the 
specified  vehicle speed and accel eratio n region "
" The averag e 
value increases  toward s three  when the vehicle speed and 
acceleration increase "
" The frequency  of the  vehicle driven in 
hybrid mode i ncreases when th e vehicle travels in rural  and 
highway maneuvers , which is a n expect ation that the efficiency 
of the ICE is higher in moderate  engine speed  and to rque ar eas"
" 
In our stochasti c approach,  this observation was used as the 
baseline"
" The whole d ataset is grou ped with res pect to defined 
SoC regions  from 0 % to 100% with 5 % incremental steps "
" For 
each group , the reside ncy of the mode chann el is obtained and 
then the values b etween two and t hree are mapped between zero 
and one to get the probability matrix"
" Finally,  the map 
distribution is a djusted as monoton ically increasing "
" The 
probability matri ces for two sam ple SoC re gions are show n in 
Fig"

" The closer the value s are to  zero, the more frequent the 
activation of the electric mode"
"  In the f irst e xample , the  SoC 
region is selec ted between  25% and 30%"
"  Since the SoC va lue is 
closer to the lower limit , the more frequent hybrid mode 
activation especially in rural and highw ay d riving region s is 
seen"
"  Contra ry to the first exa mple, the battery and there fore the 
EM can be used mor e freque ntly in  this case"
"  That is why , the

" CS Mode Behavior  
  
Overall , 1159 km of vehicle data is used for CS mode 
behavio r analysis"
" As ment ioned in the energy management 
strategy sect ion, th e mode selection of the vehicle  depends on 
the output of the probabilisti c approach "
" Theref ore, three distinct 
seed values  were used to run the vehicle model with the input  
signals to take the randomness into account during the testing of 
the model "
" 
The actual average fuel consumption  as we ll as the mod el 
results with different  seed values are expressed  in Table 2"
" The 
actual average fue l consumption of the vehicle can be se en as 
7"
35 L/1 00km 
" On the  other hand, the average fuel co nsumption  
of the th ree model results is 6"
75 L /100km
" The deviation 
between the model resu lts and t he actual fuel con sumption  is 
shown as 8"
2%
"  
As for the SoC v alidation  of the model, the average deviation 
between the actual  SoC signal and the modeled  SoC signal was 
consider ed"
" For each model run, t he average de viation was 
calculated  as 1"
"83%, 1"
"96%, and 2"
40% respectively 
" The mean 
value of the  deviation s is 2"
06%
" In addition to the tabular 
represe ntation , a time-based dia gram can be seen for the CS 
result comparison  in Fig "
 4
" For the time-based  repres entation  of 
the comparison , one of th e longest traveled measurements  with 
an average success o f the vehicle mod el on fuel consumption 
and SoC modelin g is selected "
" In the sample  measurement, the 
SoC of t he battery is between 1 0% and 16% for the model and 
actual result"
"  
Electr ic and h ybrid mode distributio ns as well as fuel 
consump tion at the end of t he test ca n be seen in Table 3"
" It was 
observed that  while  the hybrid mode distributi ons form the 
majority of the energy managemen t outp ut, the electric mode 
distributions represent the minor part of t he mode  selection 
output  for both results  because of  the CS behavior  of the test "
"  
The percentage deviation between the mode distributions is 
48"
9% and 11
1% for e lectric and h ybrid mod es respectively
"  
Since the amount of  electric  distribution is around 10 % to 15% 
for both results, the percentage d eviation  is higher  when 
compared to the hybrid mode distribution"

" Conclusions  
  
In this st udy, generating a fast-responding  vehicle model  in 
Python environment was successfully developed "
" For that 
purpose, a n objec t-oriented pro gramming str ucture with a data-
driven and map-based modeling  approach  was combined with 
data a nalytics  methods  for the interpret ation  of real-world  data"
" 
Accordin g to the results , the vehicle model can  evaluate up to 
7000  seconds of test data within 10-15 se conds"
" Additi onally , 
the model can represent  fuel consumption and  SoC behavior s in 
urban, rural , and highway driv ing conditions "
" Although  the 
avera ge fuel consumption and SoC de viations, which are around 
10% and 5%  respectively,  seem  at hig her le vels when compared 
to the studies in the litera ture, the main reason and the a dvant age 
of this study is providing a huge amount of real-world maneuver 
valida tion of the model"
"  As for futu re work, the vehicle model 
will be used  in artifici al intellige nce-based predic tive energy 
management studies "
